# NatureSounds
What is NatureSounds? NatureSounds is a spigot (premium) resource that adds ambient sounds to the game. Upon roaming the world, players will hear various sounds based on time, location, world, height etc. Sounds are played to the players through a resource-pack. This pack is created and hosted on the minecraft server itself - thus no external services such as dropbox, google drive or mediafire are required! Server administrators can configure their own custom sounds and the server will generate a resource-pack out of these automatically.
