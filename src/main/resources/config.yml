# General Configuration file for NatureSounds plugin.
# Changes is this file are only applied on a complete server restart!

# The amount of seconds between so called 'sound checks'.
# Default value is 4 (seconds). This means that every 4 seconds, we'll go over all players and check if they should hear any sounds.
# If you LOWER this value: More server impact, and players might hear sounds to frequently.
# If you HIGHER this value: Less server impact, but players might hear less sounds.
interval: 4

# A free port on your hosting machine. This works very similar to services like Dynmap.
# It allows the server to host its own resource pack. The plugin will not work if this port is claimed already.
# Default value is 8080. Typically, you want to use a value between 8000 and 9000.
port: 8080

# Debugging output is disabled by default, as it might lead to unwanted spam in the console.
# There is no need to enable this, unless you're struggling to get the plugin to work and need help.
# If you send me a PM on the Spigot Forums, I will often ask you to enable this.
