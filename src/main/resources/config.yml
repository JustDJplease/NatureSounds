# General Configuration file for NatureSounds plugin.

# The amount of seconds between so called 'sound checks'.
# Default value is 4 (seconds). This means that every 4 seconds, we'll go over all players and check if they should hear any sounds.
# If you LOWER this value: More server impact, and players might hear sounds to frequently.
# If you HIGHER this value: Less server impact, but players might hear less sounds.
